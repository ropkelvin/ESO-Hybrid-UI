# ESO Hybrid UI

AI-assisted development: AI tools contributed to portions of this addon's code and documentation. The maintainer is responsible for reviewing changes, validating behavior in ESO, and maintaining the addon.

This add-on is not created by, affiliated with or sponsored by ZeniMax Media Inc. or its affiliates.

## Current release — 3.4.0

ESO Hybrid UI is now a presentation-only addon:

- ESO's native Gamepad Mode remains active at all times.
- Keyboard-style HUD presentation is applied only to selected gameplay HUD elements.
- Gamepad input, configured controller bindings, menus, scenes, dialogs, trade, resurrection, player interaction, utility wheels, inventory and world-map routing remain owned by ESO.
- No global platform API is replaced, no temporary platform setting changes are emitted, and no native dialog, player-interaction or wheel methods are intercepted.
- Reticle controller glyph preference is applied locally to the reticle keybind control.
- Action-bar labels use ESO's native keybinding registration with the actual gamepad action names. Ultimate controls remain native ESO controls.

**Important:** The current release focuses on removing unsafe platform and interaction overrides. It does not yet recreate every pixel of the keyboard HUD while in gamepad mode; remaining layout differences will be addressed only through isolated HUD presentation changes that preserve native input and scene behavior.

## Dependency

- **Required:** LibAddonMenu-2.0 version 43 or newer.
- The dependency is declared in `ESOHybridUI.txt` with `## DependsOn: LibAddonMenu-2.0>=43`.
- **Optional:** LibGamepadOptions AddOnVersion 7 or newer. When installed, ESO Hybrid UI gets its own category in ESO's native gamepad Options menu. The keyboard LibAddonMenu panel remains available and both interfaces edit the same SavedVariables.
- Without LibGamepadOptions, the addon continues to work normally; only the native gamepad settings category is unavailable. Install LibGamepadOptions separately from [ESOUI](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info4614-libgamepadoptions.html).

## Recommended ESO settings

Open the addon's settings and click **Apply settings** once. This saves the following ESO preferences:

- Gamepad Mode: On
- Keybind Display Mode: Gamepad
- Use Keyboard Chat: On
- Return Cursor on Chat Focus: On

The addon does not silently reapply these preferences on login. It never changes the setting as a temporary visual refresh. The button can be clicked again if the player later changes them.

## Installation archive structure

The installable ZIP must contain the addon folder matching the manifest name:

```
ESOHybridUI.zip
└── ESOHybridUI/
    ├── ESOHybridUI.txt
    ├── Bindings.xml
    └── src/
        └── *.lua

README.txt is included at the ZIP root (beside the addon folder), not inside the installable AddOns folder.
```

Do not zip the repository root directly. The GitHub Actions workflow packages the installable files and uploads an `ESOHybridUI.zip` artifact on pushes to `master` and the maintenance feature branch. The root-level `README.txt` carries the required third-party disclaimer and addon notices.

## SavedVariables

Character-specific settings use ESO character IDs, which are unique across megaservers. Account-wide settings are namespaced by `GetWorldName()` so EU, NA, and PTS profiles do not overwrite each other. On first load after this change, the addon copies the previous un-namespaced account-wide profile into the current megaserver profile and leaves the legacy data intact.

## Credits and attribution

- **The Elder Scrolls Online / ZeniMax Online Studios:** game, UI framework, and addon API.
- **LibAddonMenu-2.0:** required third-party settings-library dependency; it is distributed and maintained separately by its ESOUI authors.
- **Advanced Disable Controller UI:** acknowledged as inspiration; originally by Lionas, with contributions from jc28735250 and subsequent maintenance by DoriKyll. ESO Hybrid UI does not include that project's source code or assets. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for the attribution clarification.

This repository does not bundle LibAddonMenu-2.0 or LibGamepadOptions. Install the required and optional libraries separately through ESOUI. Any directly reused third-party code or assets must retain the original license and attribution.

## In-game actions and donations

The optional donation shortcut only opens a mail draft addressed to @ZOSPlsFix. The player must manually choose whether to attach gold and the amount. The addon never attaches or modifies mail gold, sends mail, trades, automates combat, or performs other player actions.
